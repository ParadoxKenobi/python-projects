# Student Grade Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python program that calculates a student's average
score based on subject grades entered by the user.

This project was built as my **first Python project** to practice core
programming fundamentals.

---

## How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter scores for Math, English, Science, and History
- Stores the scores in a Python dictionary
- Calculates the average score
- Displays all scores and the final average
